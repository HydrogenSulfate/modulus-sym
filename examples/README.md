# Modulus Sym Examples

This contains all the supplemental data for Modulus Sym examples. This includes
validation data, training data, large CSV/STLs, etc. For the python scripts,
please refer https://github.com/nvidia/modulus-sym

## Note
If you find any directory empty, that simply means, that the example has no
additional supplemental material. You can just use the scripts from the GitHub Repo.
